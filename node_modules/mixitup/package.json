  "readme": "MixItUp\r\n=========\r\n\r\n### What is MixItUp?\r\n\r\nMixItUp is a jQuery plugin providing animated filtering and sorting.\r\n\r\nMixItUp is great for managing any categorized or ordered content like portfolios, galleries and blogs, but can also function as a powerful tool for engaging application UI and data-visualisation.\r\n\r\n### Why MixItUp?\r\n\r\nMixItUp plays nice with your existing HTML and CSS, making it a great choice for responsive layouts.\r\n\r\nRather than using absolute positioning to control layout, MixItUp is designed to work with your existing inline-flow layout. Want to use percentages, media queries, inline-block, or even flex box? No problem!\r\n\r\n### Basic Overview\r\n\r\nFor a getting started guide, tutorials, documentation and support, please visit the MixItUp website at [mixitup.kunkalabs.com](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com)\r\n\r\nA typical MixItUp workflow looks like this:\r\n\r\n#### HTML\r\n\r\nBuild your container:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"Container\">\r\n\t<div class=\"mix category-1\" data-my-order=\"1\"> ... </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"mix category-1\" data-my-order=\"2\"> ... </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"mix category-2\" data-my-order=\"3\"> ... </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"mix category-2\" data-my-order=\"4\"> ... </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n> MixItUp targets elements with the class `mix` inside a container. Categories for filtering are added as classes, and sort attributes are added as custom data attributes.\r\n\r\nBuild your filter controls:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button class=\"filter\" data-filter=\".category-1\">Category 1</button>\r\n<button class=\"filter\" data-filter=\".category-2\">Category 2</button>\r\n```\r\n> Filtering happens when filter buttons are clicked.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild your sort controls:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button class=\"sort\" data-sort=\"my-order:asc\">Ascending Order</button>\r\n<button class=\"sort\" data-sort=\"my-order:desc\">Descending Order</button>\r\n```\r\n> Sorting happens when sort buttons are clicked.\r\n\r\n#### CSS\r\n\r\nHide target elements:\r\n```css\r\n#Container .mix{\r\n\tdisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n> In your project's stylesheet, set the display property of target elements to `none`. MixItUp will show only those elements which match the current filter.\r\n\r\n#### JS\r\n\r\nInstantiate MixItUp on your container using jQuery:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(function(){\r\n\t$('#Container').mixItUp();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n> Using our container's ID, we can instantiate MixItUp with the jQuery method `.mixItUp()`\r\n\r\n### Full Documentation\r\n\r\n1. [Configuration Object](docs/configuration-object.md)\r\n1. [API Methods](docs/api-methods.md)\r\n1. [State Object](docs/state-object.md)\r\n1. [Events](docs/events.md)\r\n1. [Version 1 Migration Guide](docs/version-1-migration.md)\r\n\r\nA much prettier version of the full documentation is also available at [mixitup.kunkalabs.com/docs](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/docs)\r\n\r\n### ChangeLog\r\n\r\n1. [ChangeLog](CHANGELOG.md)\r\n\r\n### Licenses\r\n\r\nFor use in commercial projects and products we require that you purchase a commercial license.\r\n\r\nFor more information see [mixitup.kunkalabs.com/licenses](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/licenses)\r\n\r\nMixItUp is free to use in non-commercial projects under the terms of the Creative Commons CC-BY-NC license.\r\n\r\n### Support & Bugs\r\n\r\nSupport forums are provided at [mixitup.kunkalabs.com/support](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/support)\r\n\r\nWe ask that all general support questions and issues are posted there and that GitHub issues be used *only* for bug-related issues. All non-bug-related issues posted to GitHub will be closed without comment.\r\n\r\n- Please be patient while we respond to your questions as we have very limited  resources. The support forum is provided as a courtesy to MixItUp users so that knowledge can be shared – support is not guaranteed.\r\n- Please be as detailed as possible when posting. If you can include a link to your project, a CodePen or JSFiddle demo, or a even just a code snippet of your setup, it is much more likely your question will be answered quickly and correctly.\r\n- Do not email KunkaLabs with support questions. All support emails will be ignored.\r\n- If you think you’ve found a bug we encourage you to submit a GitHub Issue rather than posting in the support forums. This way we can keep bugs tracked efficiently and hopefully fix them swiftly.\r\n- When submitting a bug report please provide as much details as possible about your development environment, browser and OS, and the expected vs. resulting behaviour. Please also include any console errors that arise.\r\n- If you can pinpoint the erroneous code even better. Pull requests are always appreciated.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n-------\r\n*&copy; 2014 KunkaLabs Limited*\r\n",
